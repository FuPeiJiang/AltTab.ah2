alt+tab replacement

blue for Code.exe<br>
red for Chrome.exe<br>
white for ahk error dialogs<br>
dark for anything else<br>
(I really need a better theme palette, send rgb please)

Windows Alt+Tab sets what you see by WinTitle, but with this, you can set what you see to the content inside the window, or to anything that makes you distinguish it [fast]<br>
I set it to the error message inside ahk error dialog

right::WinClose()

is color the fastest distinction ? is text the fastest distinction ?<br>
I know that `<` is a faster to distinguish separator than `:`<br>
